# PyPassGenerator v1
This is a simple password generator I made in Python.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Microsoft Windows 8.1 or above

FEATURES:

- Adjustable Length!
- Adjustable Password Strength!
- Copy to clipboard function!

HOW TO DOWNLOAD?:

You can view the source code by clicking on "PyPassGenerator.py", or go to the "Releases" tab on the right of the screen to download the compiled version, which will work without Python installed, whereas "PyPassGenerator.py" WILL require Python

ONCE YOU HAVE THE FILE:

Slide the slider to get your desired password length, then choose a strength for the generation. The generation is as follows:

- Low: Lowercase Letters and Numbers
- Medium: Lowercase + Uppercase Letters and Numbers
- High: Lowercase + Uppercase Letters, Numbers, and Symbols

Once you have set the strength and length of your password, click "Generate Password" and your password will show. You can copy the password to your clipboard by pressing the "Copy Password to Clipboard" button, then pasting it into your desired location with ctrl + V


# ALPHA BUILD 1 OF VERSION v0.2 IS OUT

This version has a different generation method, making passwords easy to remember and read, while also being secure. Passwords will guaranteed to have at least 8 characters, a capital letter, a symbol, and at least 3 numbers. Let me know any feedback to improve on for future updates :)
