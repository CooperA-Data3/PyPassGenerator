# PyPassGenerator
This is a simple password generator I made in Python.



FEATURES:

- Adjustable Length!
- Ajdustable Password Strength!
- Copy to clipboard function!

HOW TO:
Slide the slider to get your desired password length, then choose a strength for the generation. The generation is as follows:

- Low: Lowercase Letters and Numbers
- Medium: Lowercase + Uppercase Letters and Numbers
- High: Lowercase + Uppercase Letters, Numbers, and Symbols

Once you have set the strength and length of you password, click "Generate Password" and your password will show. You can copy the password to your clipboard by pressing the "Copy Password to Clipboard" button, then pasting it into your desired location with ctrl + V
